MATLAB implementation of schemes proposed in "Robust Fingerprinting of Genomic Databases.".

The script vanilla_fp_vs_attacks.m performs random bit flipping attack and correlation attacks on the vanilla fingerprinted genomic database. 

The script robust_fp_vs_attacks.m performs random bit flipping attack and correlation attacks on the robust fingerprinted genomic database. 

Folder "functions" records the functions used in this work, e.g., the random bit flipping attack, row- and column-wise correlation attacks, vanilla fingerprinting scheme, and the row- and column-wise mitigation techniques.
